# Weather Web App

Welcome to the Weather Web App! This is a web-based application that provides weather forecasts using the weather API. With this project, I aim to showcase my skills in using APIs, promises, and async/await.

## Project Description

The Weather Web App allows you to search for a specific location and toggle between displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The look of the page changes based on the data, with the background color or images describing the weather.

## Key Features

- Search for a specific location
- Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- Dynamic page changes based on weather data
- Use of promises or async/await

## Skills Demonstrated

- Use of APIs to retrieve and display data
- Handling user interactions through event listeners and JavaScript functions
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript to dynamically create and modify HTML elements
- Applying CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and visual effects
- Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration

## Technical Details

The Weather Web App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to retrieve weather data for a specific location.

The application uses promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations, such as retrieving data from the APIs. Event listeners are used to handle user interactions, such as searching for a location or toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The page layout is achieved using CSS flexbox, with dynamic changes applied using JavaScript. The application is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Git for version control.

## Future Improvements

In future versions of the Weather Web App, I plan to implement the following features:

- Displaying additional weather information, such as wind speed and humidity
- Allowing users to save their preferred location for quick access
- Providing a more detailed forecast for the next few days
